#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

= Introduction =

Flac2All is a multi-threaded script that will convert your collection of FLAC files into either Ogg Vorbis, MP3 (with the Lame encoder), or FLAC, complete with any tags and identical file/folder structure. The script has been stable for about a year now, and it has been known to saturate 8-core machines with parallel conversions. It is useful for people with with large FLAC collections who also want a lossy version for portable media players. If wanted, the script can perform updates by skipping already converted files.

This program has been around in some form or another since 2005, with constant refinement.

The project has a freshmeat page at http://freshmeat.net/projects/flac2all

= Details =

  * Python based
  * Can convert from FLAC to mp3,ogg vorbis or FLAC
  * Multiprocess support, for parallel conversion (excellent for multi CPU setups)
  * Tags are transferred along with the conversion
  * Optionally non-flac file (like cue,jpg etc...) can be optionally copied over
  * Tested on Linux, should work on other systems with Python + required dependencies
