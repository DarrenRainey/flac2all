= Requirements =

This script depends on:

    Python (2.5+, but not 3.0).

    FLAC command line program (including supplementary progs,e.g. metaflac)

    LAME command line program (if you want mp3 encoding)

    oggenc (if you want vorbis encoding)

These programs should ideally be available in your PATH variable, if they are not, then edit the script's path variables to point to the executables.

= Usage =

== version 1.2 ==

The original script, when ran, gives you the following output:

Pretty self explanatory, and that was all the options you could specify on the command line. 

If you wanted to make any changes, you would have to edit the script yourself. Here is an example showing the variables you can tweak:

The script is pretty well commented, so you should be able to work out what needs to be set to get it exactly the way you want. If you have trouble, just email me to let me know (or you can create an issue on the tracker). 

== version 1.3 ==

Version 1.3 is the new development. Not a complete rewrite (as such it is kept at version 1). As this is still changing as we speak, there is no clear documentation on using it.

Again, running it with "-h" on the command line will point you in the right direction. When the code becomes a bit more stable we can start writing up the documentation for it here :)
